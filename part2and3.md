## ETL Pipeline Overview
The ETL pipeline processes blockchain transaction data from the Solana Blockchain. It consists of the following stages:

1. **Extraction**: Retrieves transaction data from the Solana Blockchain using the Solana Blockchain API. The extraction script, `extract_data.py`, connects to the API, retrieves the latest block hash, and extracts addresses from the block hash.

2. **Transformation**: Applies transformations to the extracted data to meet specific business rules and requirements. The transformation logic is defined in the `transformation.sql` file located in the `models/transform` directory. It includes rules such as filtering out records older than two years and extracting data only from Magic Eden contracts. The transformations are executed using DBT (Data Build Tool).

3. **Loading**: Loads the transformed data into a PostgreSQL database using Apache Spark. The data is written to the `transformed_addresses` table in the `myschema` schema.

## Running the ETL Pipeline
To run the ETL pipeline, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/your-username/etlpipeline.git
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Go to the project directory: cd etlpipeline
3. **Install Python Dependencies**: Install the required Python dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
4. 
4. **Configure PostgreSQL Connection**: Open the `profiles.yml` file located in the `.dbt` directory and modify the `dev` section with your PostgreSQL credentials:

ETL Pipeline Documentation
This document provides an overview of the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for processing blockchain transaction data from the Solana Blockchain. It includes explanations of the pipeline's functionality, decisions made during development, instructions for running the pipeline, and strategies for collaboration with data science and business teams.

1. ETL Pipeline Overview
The ETL pipeline is designed to extract transaction data from the Solana Blockchain, apply transformations based on specific business rules, and load the transformed data into a PostgreSQL database. The pipeline consists of three main stages: Extraction, Transformation, and Loading.

Extraction: The extraction stage involves retrieving transaction data from the Solana Blockchain. The extract_data.py script connects to the Solana Blockchain API, retrieves the latest block hash, extracts addresses from the block hash, and prints the unique addresses involved in the transactions.

Transformation: The transformation stage applies business rules to the extracted data. It involves two components:

DBT Transformation: The transformation logic is defined in the transformation.sql file located in the models/transform directory. It applies specific rules such as filtering data from Magic Eden contracts and excluding records older than two years. To run the transformation, execute the following command: dbt run --models transform.
Python Script Transformation: The Python script filters out transaction records older than two years and inserts the filtered transactions into a specified PostgreSQL database table.
Loading: The loading stage involves loading the transformed data into a PostgreSQL database. The transformed data is written to the transformed_addresses table in the myschema schema.

2. Decisions Made
During the development of the ETL pipeline, the following decisions were made:

Choice of Technologies: The pipeline utilizes Python, PostgreSQL, Spark, and DBT. Python is used for data extraction, transformation, and loading. PostgreSQL is used as the database for storing the transformed data. Spark is used for loading the data into the database. DBT is used for applying business rules and transformations.

Data Filtering Criteria: The decision was made to filter out transaction records older than two years during the transformation stage. This criterion can be adjusted as per specific requirements.

Integration with PostgreSQL and Spark: The ETL pipeline integrates with a PostgreSQL database for data storage. It establishes a connection to the database and inserts filtered transaction records into the specified table using Spark.

Code Organization: The pipeline code is organized into separate scripts and directories based on their functionalities. This separation enhances maintainability and allows for easy customization and troubleshooting.
